      <h1>Brittany Bull</h1>
    
      <p>I'm passionate about using STEM and Space to solve real-world problems. I was part of a team of teenage
        girls who designed South Africa's first privately owned PICO Satellite. I'm a research assistant at the
        South African National Biodiversity Institute(SANBI) working on the Wildlife Economy research team. I was
        the first African Student to study Space Systems Engineering at Morehead State University in the USA, where
        I was a team lead on the CXBN-3 satellite engineering team. I love surfing, hiking and IoT tinkering.</p>
